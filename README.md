## Description

Our application is a to-do-list/tracker application where users can create an account, create a daily goal by choosing a default goal from the dropdown menu, set an end date for that goal, and add that to their goal tracker where they can mark if the goal has been completed for the day or not. Users are also able to edit existing goals where they can select a new end date, or end the goal. Overall our project goal is to discourage neverending lists, as well as overly complicated/specific list items.

### Motivation

Our motivation behind this project was to create an app that would allow users to create a short list of broad goals to help them balance life without creating endless lists and guilt.
