## Description

Our application is a to-do-list/tracker application where users can create an account, create a daily goal by choosing a default goal from the dropdown menu, set an end date for that goal, and add that to their goal tracker where they can mark if the goal has been completed for the day or not. Users are also able to edit existing goals where they can select a new end date, or end the goal. Overall our project goal is to discourage neverending lists, as well as overly complicated/specific list items.

### Motivation

Our motivation behind this project was to create an app that would allow users to create a short list of broad goals to help them balance life without creating endless lists and guilt.

## Core Objectives Met

- When a user views the homepage, they will find a site description and buttons to login in or sign up and create an account.
- When a user attempts to sign in or create an account, they can sign in or create a password-protected account
- When a user views the user's dashboard in a logged-in state, they see a list of all the goals they are tracking.
- When a user views the user's dashboard in a logged-out state, they are asked to login.
- When a user is views any page in a logged-in or logged-out state, the footer presents an 'affirmation' that changes on page refresh.
- When a user views the 'Goal Tracker' accordian, they are able to check off whether a goal has been completed for the day, and submit to update the goal's metrics, and increase the count under 'Comp. Entries.'
- When a user clicks on the 'Create New Goals' button, the accordian drops down and users are then able to choose a goal from a dropdown, select a date through a calendar modal, and submit to create a new goal.
- When a user clicks on the 'Edit Existing Goals' button, the accordian drops down, users are able to view their existing goals and end dates, and update those end dates or end the goal.
- When a user clicks on the 'Goal Metrics' button, the accordian drops down and users are able to see a radial graph that visualizes how many times they have completed a goal.

[A user can register on signup page, then can see their empty dashboard. They then add goals and choose end dates. The user can see their list of goals and check off if the goal has been completed for the day. They can also edit the end date and see a radial chart comparing each goal and number of completions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rSsymtoXFHl1RWJXZ45H35YBOSwP5zS/view)
